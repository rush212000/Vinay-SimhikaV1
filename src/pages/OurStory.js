          Vinay would like to say we met at a photography convention 
          but really, he slid in my DM’s after seeing me at Northolt 
          garba in the queue for Dosa (because food over boys). 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          On 3rd December 2016, Vinay was almost involved in a drug deal 
          before meeting me at Liverpool Street station for the Lens Bible 
          photography convention (you can ask him more about this). On this 
          day, he impressed me by taking a picture of an armchair 
          (see picture of said armchair below). As you can tell, I was 
          easily impressed. Like the gentleman he is, Vinay left me in 
          one of the seminars by myself while he went off to have his own 
          private photoshoot. Despite being the first day we had ever met, 
          it felt as though we had known each other for years. From this 
          day on, we spoke every single day. As cheesy as it sounds, you 
          could say, just like a camera, ‘we just clicked.’

          Vinay originally planned to ask me to be his girlfriend on 
          10th March 2017. We ended up doing four different date activities 
          on that day because after each activity, he was too scared to ask 
          me out. The day started with Vinay picking me up from my house in 
          Willesden, going to Dinosaur Golf in Northolt, followed by Topgolf 
          in Watford. We then stopped for dinner at Pizza Express in Watford 
          Atria followed by the arcades in Acton. By the time he finallyyyy 
          plucked up the courage to ask me to be his girlfriend, it was the 
          next day 11th March 2017 and it was outside the picturesque 
          location of Willesden Sports Centre in Vinay’s Volkswagen Polo 
          (famously known as V11NUB)…

          Fast forward five years to 2022, our parents had given their blessing 
          and we set a date for our Indian engagement (Chandlo) for 9th October 
          2022, leaving me a small window to propose.  
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Knowing this, I came up with a plan to convince Simhika that we were 
          going on two  holidays; one on the weekend of 24th September and one 
          for my birthday weekend (1st October). The trip to Dubrovnik, Croatia 
          had been planned and we set off for the airport. At Luton Airport, I 
          was stopped at security and was made to open up my bag where I had 
          hidden the ring in my pooja. As my bags were about to get searched, 
          I was now panicking that my whole plan would fall apart before we even 
          landed in Dubrovnik. Much to my delight, my bag was rescanned without 
          ever having to be opened.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The plan then nearly fell apart once again when we landed in Dubrovnik. 
          It was late in the evening and we were both tired. Simhika asked me if 
          I would post anything from the trip on social media, to which I replied 
          without thinking “of course I am, I’m going to post the proposal.” 
          Thankfully, I managed to save myself.  
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now comes the day of the proposal where I had hired a photographer for 
          a two-hour photoshoot. Simhika found this slightly suspicious, thinking 
          I would propose within this time but the photographer completed the shoot 
          and we parted ways. Still no proposal. At this point, Simhika was convinced 
          I would propose on the next holiday (which never existed by the way). 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          That evening, I promised Simhika a fancy dinner date at Dubrovnik’s highest 
          view point, Mount Srd. Here, we stopped to take in the breath-taking sunset 
          over Dubrovnik’s Old Town. Simhika turned around for a split second and saw 
          what looked like the photographer from the morning. By the time she realised 
          what was happening, I was down on one knee and popped the question! Of course, 
          she said YES!
