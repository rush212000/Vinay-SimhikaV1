          On 3rd December 2016, Vinay was almost involved in a drug deal before 
          meeting me at Liverpool Street station for the Lens Bible photography 
          convention (you can ask him more about this). On this day, he impressed 
          me by taking a picture of an armchair (see picture of said armchair below). 
          As you can tell, I was easily impressed. Like the gentleman he is, Vinay 
          left me in one of the seminars by myself while he went off to have his own 
          private shoot with one of the photographers attending the convention. 
          Despite being the first day we had ever met, it felt as though we had 
          known each other for years. From this day on, we spoke every single day. 
          As cheesy as it sounds, you could say, just like a camera, ‘we just clicked.’

          Vinay originally planned to ask me to be his girlfriend on 10th March 2017. 
          We ended up doing 4 different date activities on that day because after 
          each activity, he was too scared to ask me out. The day started with Vinay 
          picking me up from my house in Willesden, going to Dinosaur Golf in Northolt, 
          followed by Topgolf in Watford. We then stopped for dinner at Pizza Express in 
          Watford Atria followed by the arcades in Acton. By the time he finallyyyy plucked 
          up the courage to ask me to be his girlfriend, it was the next day 11th March 2017 
          and it was outside the picturesque location of Willesden Sports Centre in Vinay’s 
          Volkswagen Polo (famously known as V11NUB)…

        The Proposal

          Fast forward five years to 2022, the time came for us to get engaged. 
          Our parents had given their blessing and we set a date for our Indian 
          engagement (Chandlo) in October 2022, giving me a small window of 
          opportunity to propose. With only two weeks left until the Chandlo, 
          Simhika knew I would propose on one of these two weekends. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Knowing this, I came up with a plan to convince Simhika that we were 
          going to go on holiday on both weekends. The trip to Dubrovnik, Croatia 
          had been planned and we set off for the airport. At Luton airport, I got 
          stopped at security and was made to open up my bag where I had cleverly 
          hidden the ring in my pooja. As my bags were about to get searched and 
          Simhika refused to leave my side, I was now panicking that my whole plan 
          would fall apart before we even landed in Dubrovnik. Much to my delight, 
          my bag got rescanned without ever having to be opened.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The plan then nearly fell apart once again when we landed in Dubrovnik. 
          It was late in the evening and we were both tired on the coach to our 
          accommodation. Simhika asked me if I would post anything from the trip 
          on social media, to which I replied without thinking “of course I am, I’m 
          going to post the proposal.” 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now comes the day of the proposal where I had hired a photographer for a 
          two-hour photoshoot. Simhika found this slightly suspicious, thinking I 
          would propose within these two hours but the photographer completed the 
          shoot and we parted ways. Still no proposal. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          That evening, I lured Simhika out of the house with a promise of a fancy 
          dinner date at Dubrovnik’s highest view point, Mount Srd. Here, we stopped 
          to take in the breath-taking views of Dubrovnik’s Old Town. Simhika turned 
          around for a split second and saw what looked like the photographer from 
          the morning photo session. By the time she realised what was happening, 
          I was down on one knee and popped the question! Of course, she said YES!
